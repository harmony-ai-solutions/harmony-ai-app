# Harmony AI App Product Context
@Problems:
- Harmony Link users: AI characters only on desktop/game engines, no mobile access
- Privacy users: Cloud AI collects all data, no private alternative
- Power users: Commercial apps limited customization, closed source
- Offline scenarios: Cloud AI needs constant connection
@Solution:
- Mobile app syncs with Harmony Link backend (self-hosted privacy)
- Open-source codebase (full customization)
- On-device AI via Executorch (offline functionality)
- Flexible backend: Harmony Link (privacy) or Harmony Cloud (convenience)
@Benefits: Complete privacy (self-hosted), anywhere access (mobile), offline capability (local models), full control (open-source), character persistence (cross-device sync).
@UX Goals:
- Simplicity: One-tap cloud setup, clear self-hosted tutorials
- Privacy: Transparent data handling, clear backend mode indication
- Reliability: Stable connections, robust offline, no message loss
- Natural: Realistic timing, character personality, context-aware
@Flow: Setup (choose backend) → Character Selection → Chat (natural conv) → Sync (cross-device) → Offline (graceful fallback).
@Roadmap:
- P1 Foundation: Basic chat, Harmony Link connection, local storage, character selection
- P2 Enhanced: On-device AI, voice (STT/TTS), images, rich profiles
- P3 Integration: Messengers (WhatsApp/Telegram), group chat, multi-character
- P4 Advanced: Custom character creation, memory viz, relationship graphs
@Differentiators: Privacy-first (self-hosted option unique), character persistence (deep memory), open-source (full transparency), ecosystem integration (Harmony Link/games), realistic behavior (advanced timing/personality).
@Metrics: Adoption (MAU, retention), engagement (messages/day, session length), performance (latency, sync reliability), privacy (self-hosted vs cloud split).
