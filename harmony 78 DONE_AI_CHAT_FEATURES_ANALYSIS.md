### Kindroid AI: The Visual & Memory Architect

#### Character Creation & Persona Definitions
* Customizable Companions: Users shape the AI's personality by crafting a detailed backstory and implanting key memories. The AI learns the user's style and preferences over time.
* Roleplay Focus: Explicit use cases include roleplay partner, language tutor, mentor, and confidant.

#### Appearance / Images / Portraits
* AI-Generated Visuals: Users can Visualize their AI companion through unique, diffusion-generated selfie images.
* Visual Consistency: The images reflect the AI's personality and maintain a consistent visual identity. Users can choose from animated avatars or upload their own.

#### Memory Outside of Chat Session
* Five Layered System: Memory is split across five memory systems that work together. This includes user-inputted and AI-generated data.
* Persistent Memory: Functions like a notes sheet that the Kindroid can always refer to. This is where the backstory and other core data reside.
* Cascaded Memory: A proprietary system for medium-term memory that hierarchically organizes memories to bridge the gap between short-term context and long-term memory. It expands effective conversation history to hundreds or thousands of messages, albeit at a lower fidelity.
* Retrievable Memory (Long-Term): This memory is infinite in quantity but can be more unreliable in recall. Consolidation of memory (from individual chats, group chats, and voice calls) happens automatically when the AI deems it appropriate.

#### Special Features
* Voice calls: Offers real-time voice calls using state-of-the-art audio transcription and best-in-class text-to-speech (TTS) for human-like voices with V2 (fast) and V3 (expressive, emotions) options, plus video calls, screen sharing, background operation, and multilingual support across 29 languages with different mixing capabilities.
* Media/Internet Access: The AI companion can access the internet, view links, and see images/videos (10 images or 1 video/32MB max), with temporary web browsing activated per message and content persisting in chat history for ongoing reference.
* Group Chats: Users can create group chats with multiple Kindroids featuring shared memory toggle, turn-taking modes (automatic with @mentions or manual), group context for shared backstory, and proactive interaction capabilities including AI-initiated messages, voice messages, selfies, and voice calls with user-configurable directives and quiet hours.
* Visual Features: AI-generated selfies with prompt enhancement, custom avatars, video selfies with motion prompts, group selfies (2-3 Kindroid composites), animated avatars, auto-selfies from conversation context, and inpainting for image editing.

#### Current Limitations
* Voice: V3 expressive voices not available for real-time calls due to latency, English STT model prevents language switching during calls, video calls require foreground app operation on mobile
* Visual: Custom avatar animations may have artifacts on stylized faces, group selfies can cause bleeding between Kindroids, NSFW engine only available on web version
* Memory: Cascaded memory limited to paid subscribers, long-term memory recall can be unreliable, journal entry recall limited to 3 individual + 3 global entries per message
* Platform: Calendar integration auto-disconnects after 14 days of inactivity, mobile background operation limited to audio-only calls, Picture-in-Picture video only available on iOS

### Character AI: The Prompt-Driven Roleplayer

#### Character Creation & Persona Definitions
* Core Profile: Creation involves defining a Name, a Greeting (a crucial, high-impact first line), and a Short Description (a concise overview of the character and scenario).
* Character's Note/Definition: This includes core traits like Personality, Physical Description, Motivations, Backstory, and Relationships. A persona reconstruction framework is used to organize character information.
* User Persona: Users can define their own Persona (their information) to prevent the AI from making wrong assumptions and to reinforce how the user should be roleplayed. > Note: Overly long personas can potentially degrade bot memory and performance due to context window limitations.

#### Appearance / Images / Portraits
* Focus: Primarily uses a profile picture/portrait. The core focus is on textual descriptions of appearance within the character definition.

#### Memory Outside of Chat Session
* Context Window Limitation: The primary constraint is the LLM's context window (approx. 3200 letters/tokens). Both the Character Profile and the User Persona consume this limited space.
* Pinned Memories: C.AI+ users reportedly have access to pinned memories (up to 30) to reinforce key facts.
* Accuracy/Training: Users are responsible for "training" the AI by editing, directing, or rerolling responses to break repetitive loops and enforce character consistency across long conversations. Memory can vary drastically from one chat to another.

#### Special Features
* Core Interaction: Text-based conversation and roleplay.
* Focus: Heavy emphasis on narrative flow and character consistency, managed primarily through the prompt/persona design.
* AvatarFX to power current video generation on the platform.

### Voice Feature:

Character AI's voice feature is a significant and free offering that is crucial to analyze, as it directly competes with Harmony AI's planned Premium Tier media features.
* Offers Character Calls for a two-way voice conversation experience, much like a phone call with a friend.
* Real-Time & Low Latency: Processes real-time speech inputs, interprets intent and emotion, and generates personalized vocal responses in milliseconds. This is a crucial factor for the user experience.
* Emotional Alignment: Uses Advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interpret the speaker's intentions, ensuring responses are natural and emotionally aligned with the conversation.
* Multilingual Support: Supports speaking and responding in multiple languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and many more).
* Switching Modalities: Users can seamlessly switch between texting and talking at any point in the conversation.

#### Custom Voice Creation
* Community Voice Library: Provides a selection of pre-made and user-created Voices that can be assigned to any Character in a 1:1 chat.
* User-Generated Voices: Users can create their own Voices by uploading an audio sample or recording a sound.
* Visibility Control: Users control the visibility of their created Voices (Private or Public).
* Virtual Currency: Charms are an in-app virtual currency used to unlock access to special features.
    * They are earned primarily through Quests (daily check-ins, starter tasks, weekly challenges) and general activity within the app, designed to reward regular engagement. C.AI+ members receive a bonus.
